# React refs

Complete the App.js using useRef in it.
You are given an Email field having id inputEmail, Password field having id inputPassword and a button Submit having id submitButton and two &lt;p&gt; tags , first having id emailText displaying the Email entered in Input and second &lt;p&gt; tag having id passwordText displaying the password entered in the Input.

You have to make sure that when button is clicked then email and password entered via Input get displayed in the relevant &lt;p&gt; tags and if any of the input is empty then when button is clicked that input tag becomes focussed.(as in demo, you can see the black outline around the input).

Note:- If both field are empty only the field which is first in the form will be focused(since only one field can be focussed at a time, example #inputEmail when we click button without anything in either fields)
